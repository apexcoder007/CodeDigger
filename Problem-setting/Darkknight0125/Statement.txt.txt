Number of good subsequences

Arun and Kinshuk are roommates and are demanding a Party from Saman, but Saman being the miser person he is, does not want to give a Party.
He gives them a sequence of numbers, and says the budget of the party is the number of good subsequences in it.

A subsequence is good if it satisfies 2 conditions:
1. All elements are unique.
2. If A is the minimum number and B is the maximum number in the subsequence, then all numbers [A....B] must also be there in the subsequence.
Example - (4,1,2,5,3) is a good subsequence while (2,2,1) and (3, 7) are not.

Help Arun and Kinshuk to party.

Input:
First line has N, the length of array.
Next line has N numbers in them.

Output:
Return the number of good subsequences. Answer may be large so return module 1e9 + 7.

Constraints:
1 <= N <= 1e5
1 <= Number <= 1e5
=> All elements are unique (Easy version)
=> There may be duplicate elements (Hard version)
