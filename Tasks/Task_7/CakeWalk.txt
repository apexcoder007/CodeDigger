                                                      CAKEWALK PROBLEM

Uttu hates discrimination. So he decided to end discrimination in this deceptive world.
To do this he started with the discrimination with the alphabets.
He wonders, “Why should always A be lexicographically before B ?”
So he comes up with a new string which is a permutation of alphabets where
if index of c1 < index of c2, c1 is lexicographically smaller than c2.
 
Now you are given a set of some words and Uttu asks you to sort them according to the new rule of comparing alphabets lexicographically.

Since the world suffers with the social evil Discrimination, you need to save it by sorting the words.
